# Kubei 

Kubei is a vulnerabilities scanning tool that allows users to get an accurate and immediate risk assessment of their kubernetes clusters. Kubei scans all images that are being used in a Kubernetes cluster, including images of application pods and system pods. It doesn’t scan the entire image registries and doesn’t require preliminary integration with CI/CD pipelines. 

It is a configurable tool which allows users to define the scope of the scan (target namespaces), the speed, and the vulnerabilities level of interest.

It provides a graphical UI which allows the viewer to identify where and what should be replaced, in order to mitigate the discovered vulnerabilities. 


## Prerequisites 

1. A Kubernetes cluster is ready, and kubeconfig ( ```~/.kube/config```) is properly configured for the target cluster.

## Configurations 

1. The file ```kubei.yaml``` is used to deploy and configure Kubei on your cluster.

2. Set the scan scope. Set the parameter ```ignore namespaces``` to ignore specific namespaces.

1. Set the scan speed. Expedite scanning by running parallel scanners. Set the ```max-parallelism``` field for the maximum number of simultaneous scanners.

## Use 

1. Run the following command to deploy Kubei on the cluster:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f kubei.yaml 
    ```

2. Then, run this command to configure the port for communication:

    ```
	kubectl -n kubei  port-forward kubei <port>:8080 
    ```    
	For example, to configure port 5556:
	
	```kubectl -n kubei  port-forward kubei 5556:8080```

3. In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:port/view/ , and then click  'GO' to run a scan (for example: http://localhost:5556/view/)

4. To check the state of Kubei, and the progress of ongoing scans, run the following command:

    ```
	kubectl -n kubei  port-forward kubei <port>:8080  
    ```
	
	For example, for port 5556:
	
	```kubectl -n kubei  port-forward kubei 5556:8080```

5. Refresh the page (http://localhost:port/view/) to update the results.

## Limitations 

1. Supports Kubernetes Image Manifest V 2, Schema 2 (https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/). It will fail to scan on earlier versions.
 
2. The CVE database will update once a day.
